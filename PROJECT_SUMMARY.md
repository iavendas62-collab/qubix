# Qubix Compute Hub - Project Summary

## Overview

Qubix Compute Hub is the **first decentralized AI compute marketplace** built natively on Qubic blockchain. It connects miners with idle computational power to developers and enterprises who need resources to train AI models.

## Key Innovation

Leverages Qubic's upcoming **"Outsourced Computations"** feature (Q2-Q3 2025 roadmap) to create a complete ecosystem for AI compute trading.

## Core Features

### 1. Compute Marketplace
- Miners rent out idle compute power
- Developers submit AI training/inference jobs
- Automatic job-provider matching
- Real-time job monitoring

### 2. Smart Contract Escrow
- Secure payment handling
- Automatic fund release on completion
- Dispute resolution mechanism
- 3% protocol fee (burned for deflation)

### 3. Model Hub
- Share and monetize trained AI models
- Browse pre-trained models
- Royalty distribution system
- Download tracking

### 4. Cross-Chain Bridges
- Ethereum integration (ERC-20)
- Solana integration (SPL)
- Expand user base beyond Qubic

### 5. Developer Tools
- Python SDK
- CLI tool
- REST API
- WebSocket for real-time updates
- EasyConnect templates (Zapier, n8n)

## Technology Stack

### Backend
- Node.js + TypeScript
- Express.js
- PostgreSQL (Prisma ORM)
- Redis (caching + job queue)
- Bull (job processing)
- WebSocket (real-time updates)

### Frontend
- React 18
- TypeScript
- TailwindCSS
- React Query
- Vite

### Smart Contracts
- Qubic C++
- Job escrow logic
- Provider registry
- Reputation system

### Infrastructure
- Docker + Docker Compose
- CI/CD pipeline
- Monitoring & logging

## Business Model

### Revenue Streams
1. **Transaction Fees**: 3% on all compute jobs (burned)
2. **Model Marketplace**: 2% royalty on model sales
3. **Premium Tiers**: Enterprise features
4. **Partnership Revenue**: Integration partnerships

### Market Opportunity
- AI compute market: $50B+ by 2027
- Decentralized compute: Growing rapidly
- Qubic ecosystem: Early mover advantage

## Competitive Advantages

1. **First Mover**: No native AI compute marketplace on Qubic
2. **Timing**: Aligns with Outsourced Computations launch
3. **Complete Solution**: End-to-end developer experience
4. **Network Effects**: More providers = more attractive to consumers
5. **Ecosystem Alignment**: Project Qubic wants to see succeed

## Hackathon Strategy

### Nostromo Track
- Real Qubic integration (TCP socket)
- Smart contracts in Qubic C++
- Leverages Outsourced Computations
- Full node interaction

### EasyConnect Track
- Visual workflow templates
- Zapier/n8n integrations
- Discord/Telegram bots
- No-code job submission
