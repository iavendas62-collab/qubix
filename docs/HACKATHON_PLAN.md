## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Qubic Node Access**: Use mock data if node unavailable
2. **Smart Contract Complexity**: Focus on core escrow logic
3. **Time Constraints**: Prioritize MVP features

### Mitigation Strategies
- Mock Qubic responses for development
- Simplify smart contract scope
- Use feature flags for incomplete features
- Prepare backup demo video

## Demo Script

### Opening (30 sec)
"Qubic just launched Outsourced Computations - but there's no marketplace connecting compute supply with demand. We built Qubix."

### Problem (30 sec)
- Miners have idle compute power
- Developers need AI training resources
- No native solution exists on Qubic

### Solution (60 sec)
- Live demo: Submit AI training job
- Show provider matching
- Display real-time progress
- Show payment settlement

### Business Model (30 sec)
- 3% transaction fee
- Model marketplace royalties
- Enterprise partnerships

### Closing (30 sec)
"Qubix is the infrastructure that makes Qubic the go-to platform for decentralized AI compute. Join us in building the future."
